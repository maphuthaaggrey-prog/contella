      content: [`After making major waves in the South African Hip-Hop scene last year, the Qwellers have finally dropped their much-anticipated debut album titled EGALINI. The rising group had fans on edge waiting for the full project — and they definitely delivered.`,
                `EGALINI is a double-sided album packed with 17 solid tracks, showcasing the group’s lyrical range, street-smart storytelling, and unique sound. It also comes with heavyweight features from some of the best in the game, including K.O, Blxckie, KindlyNxsh, and HENNYBELIT, adding more firepower to an already strong body of work.`,
                `The album rollout was well-timed and visually striking, with bold cover art and a full tracklist reveal just days before the official release.`,
                `They kept the energy high by dropping lead singles, including KEKELA, a fan favorite that dropped a week before the full album. Another standout track, iphone, was teased earlier in March on SABC 1’s live music show The Unplug, creating even more buzz around the album.`,
                `With EGALINI, the Qwellers prove they’re not just a hype act — they’re here for the long run. The album is a true reflection of their growth, hunger, and identity in the Hip-Hop space. Whether you’re a long-time supporter or just getting to know them, this release is a must-listen.`,

        `Cotton Fest 2025 proved once again why it remains one of South Africa’s most electric cultural events. Held under the theme “The Faculty of Science”, this year’s edition fused music, fashion, and youth culture with a unique nod to creativity’s roots in science and rhythm.`, 
        `The festival featured over 100 artists performing across three stages: the Cotton Fest Stage, the Bunker Stage (powered by Play Energy), and The Lot Stage (powered by Jägermeister). Notable performers included A-Reece, Cassper Nyovest, Kabza De Small, Kamo Mphela, Blxckie, DBN Gogo, Focalistic, Young Stunna, and Sjava, among others.`,
        `From hip-hop and amapiano to street art and skate culture, Cotton Fest was a full-sensory celebration of South African talent.`,
        `Earlier in March, the Cotton Fest Exchange kicked off at The Hub in Braamfontein, creating a space for young creatives and entrepreneurs to connect, showcase their work, and build their brands.`,
        `The 2025 edition was powered by major brands including Coke Studio, Youth X by Nedbank, Flying Fish, Klipdrift, Jägermeister, Play Energy, Vuse, and Velo, with exclusive broadcasting partners MTV Base and YFM. `,

        `Kane Keid has experienced a meteoric rise with a multitude of co-signs from artists abroad and he recently signed a distribution deal with Roc Nation, which is a major win for the rising talent. His first release under the distribution deal is his EP titled NOT FAMOUS.`,
        `The EP begins on an uptempo note with bangers such as ‘TESTED’, ‘CAN’T DECIDE’ and ‘TROUBLE AGAIN’. Despite the high tempo beginning, that isn’t the whole story of the EP. He goes on to deliver songs that flex his lyrical ability with songs like ‘LEAP OF FAITH’ and ‘DON’T KNOW ME’. Proving that he cannot be boxed into one lane of the game. With an offering this versatile, Kane Keid must have the wonderful headache of deciding who he wants to be, what message he wants to share through the music and the impact he wants to leave. Listen to NOT FAMOUS below.`,
