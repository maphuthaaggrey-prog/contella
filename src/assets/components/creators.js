            `Anashe Ithiel Chizhande, known as KindlyNxsh (Young Soldier), is a 22-year-old artist from Johannesburg, born on January 4, 2003.

He began his music career at 15, when he made the bold decision to drop out of Concord College High School to pursue his passion for music full-time.`, 
            `He quickly became hooked on the making music software, diving headfirst into production. Initially, he didn’t envision himself as a rapper but focused on engineering. As he mastered mixing and producing, eventually working with prominent South African artists such as Blxckie, Sjava, AKA, Costa Titch, Nadia Nakai and more. He began rapping over his beats. Influenced by artists like Smokepurpp, Comethazine, Ski Mask the Slump God, and EDM producers like Mesto, Skrillex, and Virtual Riot.`,
            `Working with a diverse array of artists has been instrumental in shaping KindlyNxsh’s music and character. The collaborations have allowed him to absorb valuable lessons and experiences from seasoned artists, who often see him as the youngest in the room. This has fostered a continuous learning environment that has significantly contributed to his growth.`,
            `In January 2024, seeking to establish himself as an all-around artist, KindlyNxsh decided to focus on producing and performing his own music. He independently released tracks like "Where Did You Go?", "Militant Mayne", and "Military Basin," gaining significant attention. His breakthrough came with the hit single "Eish Chief" in June 2024, which amassed over 1,000,000 streams within a month.`,
            `Beyond music, KindlyNxsh is a full-fledged artist. He animates, edits, and designs all the art and animations seen on his pages, including his cover arts.

His grandmother gave him the nickname "LaQhasha."`,
            `LaCabra moved to Johannesburg in pursuit of opportunities, driven by the desire to succeed in the music industry.

            `Kane Keid (real name: Lonwabo Nkhoesa) is a rising South African hip-hop artist known for his introspective lyrics and storytelling abilities. Born on August 22, 2003, he grew up in Tembisa, a small township called Mayibuye, before moving to the suburbs. His early life in Mayibuye heavily influenced his music, where he witnessed the harsh realities of township life, which he later channeled into his lyrics.`,
            `Kane Keid’s journey into music began at a young age, writing his first raps at 12 and recording his first song, “Do What I Like,” at 14, inspired by Nasty C’s “Juice Back.” However, his first official release was a collaboration titled “Heard It All” with Gwaza, a respected rapper from his hometown, which earned him recognition within his community.`, 
            `His debut project, “Dressed In Destruction,” released in 2020, although not professionally recorded, helped him gain a following in surrounding neighborhoods. In 2023, Kane Keid was part of the Top 10 in the Sportscene Put Me On competition and released his official debut mixtape, “DOLLAR,” further solidifying his place in the South African hip-hop scene.`,
            `In 2024, his song “Not Famous (Black Boy Fly)” gained significant attention, showcasing his lyrical prowess and the depth of his music. He continues to build his presence in the industry with new releases and collaborations, such as his latest track “War Ready,” featuring Priddy Ugly and Tyson Sybateli​`,
            `Keid confronted the pressures of having to evolve in the industry while staying authentic to his core and not losing the essence of who he is and what he is all about on his latest single “Trouble Again” alongside his Durban contemporary Usimamane. Reinvention, in its truest form, often invites one to turn away from familiarity and it is a call that beckons one to question their own satisfaction with where they were currently standing in life. The rapper, however, expressed how he felt about who he was and who he was aspiring to be.`,
